# Screenshot Guide for Chrome Web Store

## Required Screenshots (1280x800px or 640x400px)

## Quick Screenshot Tips:
1. Use Chrome's built-in screenshot tool (Cmd+Shift+5 on Mac)
2. Crop to show just the relevant parts of the interface
3. Make sure text is readable and interface is clear
4. Use consistent browser/interface styling across screenshots

## Optional: Promotional Images
- Small tile: 440x280px
- Large tile: 920x680px  
- Marquee: 1400x560px

These are optional but help with discoverability in the Chrome Web Store.
